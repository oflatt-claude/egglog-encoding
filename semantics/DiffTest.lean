# Differential test case generator

Writes one `.egg` file and one `.expected` file per case. `scripts/difftest.sh` runs
egglog on the former and diffs its `(print-size)` output against the latter.

Two kinds of case. The **curated** ones are the Redex `test.rkt` programs plus a few
variations, so they are only as good as whoever picked them. The **random** ones are
generated from a seed by a fixed linear congruential stream, which is what removes that
selection bias — the `redex-check` analogue the Redex had and this port did not.

One invocation writes one case, so that a generated program which happens to blow up
cannot take the rest of the run down with it; the script applies a timeout per case.

Cases use nullary constructors rather than literals, since egglog's `i64` is a distinct
primitive sort while `Term.lit` shares a sort with applications here (see `Egg.lean`).

A fixed signature — two nullary constructors, one unary, one binary — keeps every
generated program expressible in egglog, where one name may not be used at two arities.
Depths are small on purpose: a rule whose head builds a deep term grows the term set fast,
and the enumerator is |terms| ^ |vars|. -/
