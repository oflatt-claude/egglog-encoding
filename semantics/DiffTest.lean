# Differential test case generator

Writes one `.egg` file and one `.expected` file per case. `scripts/difftest.sh` runs
egglog on the former and diffs its `(print-size)` output against the latter.

Two kinds of case. The **curated** ones are the Redex `test.rkt` programs plus a few
variations, so they are only as good as whoever picked them. The **random** ones are
generated from a seed by a fixed linear congruential stream, which is what removes that
selection bias — the `redex-check` analogue the Redex had and this port did not.

One invocation writes one case, so that a generated program which happens to blow up
cannot take the rest of the run down with it; the script applies a timeout per case.

Cases use nullary constructors rather than literals, since egglog's `i64` is a distinct
primitive sort while `Term.lit` shares a sort with applications here (see `Egg.lean`).

/-! ### `:merge` cases (M9)

The first empirical check on M9. Every generated merge is a **join** — `min`/`max` on
`i64` — for a reason: our reads over-approximate, so a non-idempotent merge would give
extra firings and extra values, and a row-count difference would be this model's design
showing rather than a real bug.

Merge functions here are written and never read. A body atom reading one would bind the
variable to *any* recorded output, where egglog binds the current one, so the model would
fire more and build more. That is the fragment's boundary, and it is where the
over-approximation would first become observable.

`min-rebuild` is the case that matters: unioning the keys makes two `Dist` rows collide,
so egglog's table drops from two rows to one. It is the shape of
`egglog/tests/merge-during-rebuild.egg`, with nullary constructors in place of `(Node
i64)`. Row counts see it because they count *key classes*, which is also why the
interpreter need not saturate merges to predict them.
