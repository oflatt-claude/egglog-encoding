# The completeness half, assembled

`Encoding/Correspond.lean` proves the forward half outright from properties of the two states
and reduces the completeness half to one invariant of the state `execM` returned —
`FDatabase.SoundTerms`, the term-list form of `Database.ViewsSound` and
`Database.EdgesSound`. Everything the invariant's *writers* owe is discharged there — the
whole merge phase included (`mergeSaturateF_soundTerms`) — except the two a rule head has:
`entrySound_headBuild` and `cong_headUnion`, which need the query-to-substitution
correspondence and so live in `Encoding/Match.lean`.

That is the whole reason this file exists. `Encoding/Match.lean` is **downstream** of
`Encoding/Correspond.lean`, so the residue that consumes its two head-writer lemmas cannot be
stated where the rest of the completeness half is; the four theorems below are the ones that
have to be after it, and nothing else moved. The witnesses and refutations that pin the
statement — `encode_corresponds_witness`, `encode_corresponds_invents_enode`,
`encode_corresponds_unions_literals` and `execM_soundTerms_false` — depend on none of them and
stay in `Encoding/Correspond.lean`, which is what keeps `DiffTest.lean`'s imports unchanged.

/-- **The residue of the completeness half. Not proved.**

**It was false, twice over, and the domain now excludes both.** A source rule head that gets
*stuck* contributes nothing — `RuleResults` asks `evalLocalActions` for a `some` — and its
encoding's head, which is `.set`s, writes anyway. `Encoding/Correspond.lean`'s
`execM_soundTerms_false` is a head applying a constructor nobody declared, and its
`encode_corresponds_unions_literals` is a head unioning two literals; the second refutes not
this residue but `encode_corresponds_complete` **itself**, at a pair of terms the source holds
and the two membership hypotheses are satisfied at. So `EncodeDomain.noLitUnion` and
`EncodeDomain.headsDeclared` are load-bearing for the conclusion and not only for the
proof, and everything below is stated under them.

`Database.ViewsSound` and `Database.EdgesSound` at the state `execM` returned, in the term-list
form the run can carry (`viewsSound_of_soundTerms` is the step back). Every *per-entry*
obligation is discharged, one per writer `encode` emits — `entrySound_build`,
`EntrySound.eclass`, `EntrySound.column`, `EntrySound.select`, `cong_of_entrySound_collide`,
`cong_of_eqs`, `cong_of_pathCompress` here, and `entrySound_headBuild`/`cong_headUnion` in
`Encoding/Match.lean` for the two writers a rule head has — so what is missing is the
*induction that applies them*, and what that still needs.

* **The interpreter's writers, enumerated. The merge phase and the rule-firing fold are both
  done; the source rule's *head* is not.** `unionsInv_step`'s five closed cases only ever need
  the terms a block of `set`s wrote,
  which `holdsBuild_of_execProgramM` reads back off `execActions`. This invariant owes *every*
  term the run adds, and every command `encodeCmd` emits for a writing source command ends in
  `Cmd.saturate rebuildRuleset` — so no case closes without "every term `execRunRules` and
  `FDatabase.mergeRound` add is one of these `set`s'". What the fold has to compose was already
  settled: `FDatabase.SoundTerms.addTerm`, `.addRow` and `.union` are the three writers of
  `terms` there are, `FDatabase.empty_soundTerms` is the base case, and
  `FDatabase.SoundTerms.mono_src` carries a clause proved at a command's pre-state onto the
  source the whole run finishes at.

  **The double fold over row pairs is now proved**: `mergeSaturateF_soundTerms`, out of
  `mergeRound_soundTerms` and `mergeOneOriented_soundTerms`, and it asks nothing of a merge
  firing beyond the state. The two obstacles that stood in front of it are gone.
  `Signature.MergeShape` is the sig-shape invariant — only `@UF` and the views carry a
  `:merge`, both carry `mergeBody`, and both are two columns wide — and
  `execM_encode_mergeShape` establishes it at the target, out of the prelude's declarations
  and the fact that `encodeCmds` emits none. `eq_of_congrKeys` is the other: a pass compares
  keys against a **diagonal** closure, so congruent keys are equal keys, which is what makes
  the two colliding rows two entries at *one* key and hence
  `cong_of_entrySound_collide`/`EntrySound.select`'s hypothesis. The body itself is read back
  by `execActions_mergeBody_inv` and `evalList_mergeResult_inv`, whose content is that each of
  the four selectors answers with one of the two columns it chose between
  (`mergeSelector_cases`) — which is all either write needs, and is why the tie-break never
  enters. The two rows are turned into entry terms by `mem_terms_of_indexOk`, which is
  `FDatabase.IndexOk.entry` read at a diagonal state. `cxPre_mergeOneOriented_writes` is the
  firing happening at a state a program reaches, writing an edge the state did not hold.

  **The fold over rule firings is now proved too, and so are the three maintenance
  families.** `execRunRules` is a fold of `fireRule` over the ruleset's rules and `fireRule` a
  fold of `fireInto` over the matches, *all read off the round's pre-state* — so what a round
  owes is one obligation per firing at that one state, which is `FDatabase.FiringsSound`, and
  `fireInto_soundTerms`, `fireRule_soundTerms`, `execRunRules_soundTerms` and
  `runRoundM_soundTerms` are the fold and the merge phase after it. The **rule invariant** it
  needed is `execM_encode_rules`: every rule a target holds is `(encodeRule i s n).1` for a
  source rule `s` of `P`, or one of `maintenanceRules P` (`Rule.EncodedIn`,
  `FDatabase.RulesEncoded`), established at the prelude and carried because `encodeCmd` emits a
  rule only for a source `.rule` — `mergeShapeOk_encodePrelude`'s shape one level up. And the
  **maintenance side of the split is discharged**: `maintenance_soundTerms`, out of
  `pathCompressRule_soundTerms` (`cong_of_pathCompress`), `eclassRule_soundTerms`
  (`EntrySound.eclass`) and `columnRule_soundTerms` (`EntrySound.column`). Three things paid
  for those. `mem_terms_of_patternHolds_values` reads a matched row atom back as an entry term
  at **either** of `patternHolds`' branches — the index one through
  `FDatabase.IndexOk.entry`, the constructor one off `terms` — so the two never have to be told
  apart. `Expr.eval_of_refines` moves a reading from the substitution the *pattern* was checked
  at (`Env.canon` of the pattern's own free variables) to the one the *head* runs under.
  And `entryShaped_mem_of_eval` is what makes a minted proof column cost nothing: no head the
  encoding applies inside a proof is a view or `@UF` — `viewName_ne_congrName` is the last
  separation that was missing, and `Nat.isDigit_of_mem_toDigits` is what pays for it — while a
  *primitive* answers with a literal or with one of its own operands (`prim_apply_cases`), so
  the clause under a proof node is answered by the columns the match bound.

  **`firingsSound_of_rulesEncoded` is the factorisation those leave.** What is unproved is one
  firing of one **encoded source rule** — `entrySound_headBuild`/`cong_headUnion`, whose
  `hfired` is discharged and whose two remaining conditions are below — and the per-command
  induction that aligns the source run with the target's, since the head's reading is at the
  *contemporaneous* source state and `FDatabase.SoundTerms.mono_src` is what carries it to the
  end. `FDatabase.Inv.execCmdM` and `Signature.MergesLegal` at the encoded signature are the
  two side conditions `mergeSaturateF_soundTerms` and `runRoundM_soundTerms` then want per
  command, and a `.saturate` needs `FDatabase.FiringsSound` at every round it passes through
  rather than only at the first.
* **The row-to-entry direction, which is the one that is *not* refuted, and it is proved.** A
  rule fires off `d.rows` (`patternHolds`), and turning a matched row into a `Database.Out` is
  `FDatabase.IndexOk.entry` — a row is an entry term. That is the direction soundness needs,
  and `mem_terms_of_patternHolds_values` is it.
  `FDatabase.IndexCurrent` is its converse, and `cxTgt_not_indexCurrent` refutes *that*; so the
  refutation that blocks `execM_viewLeaderRows` does not block this residue, which is why the
  two are separate holes. `patternHolds_values_of_mem_rows` is the *converse* of the reading —
  a row makes its own atom hold, at the values its own columns are — and it is what says the
  three families are not vacuous: `cxRb_mem_matchQuery` is a maintenance rule's query really
  matching at a state two `set`s leave, **proved rather than decided**, since `matchQuery`
  computes a closure and `closureF` does not reduce in the kernel. `cxRb_eclassRule_writes` is
  the head writing an entry the state did not hold — it is `cxPre`'s third `set`, so the
  merge-phase witness above is the state this firing produced — and
  `cxRb_eclassRule_soundTerms` is every hypothesis of `eclassRule_soundTerms` holding together
  there, over a source (`cxRbSrc`) that really derives the equation the matched edge carries.
* **`hfired` was where the falsity was, and it is now discharged.**
  `entrySound_headBuild` and `cong_headUnion` ask that the *source* rule fired at the
  substitution the correspondence returns, and `RuleResults` makes a firing a valid
  substitution **plus a block that evaluates**. `exists_validQuerySubst_of_encodeQuery`
  delivers the substitution and nothing more; a valid substitution is therefore *not* a
  firing, and the two refutations above are exactly the gap. Three parts, all three **proved**,
  and `mem_terms_of_headBuild_of_domain`/`mem_eqs_of_headUnion_of_domain` are the two shapes
  composed:
  * *A firing's writes reach the post-state.* `mem_terms_of_ruleFired` and
    `mem_eqs_of_ruleFired`, off `runRules_eqs_subset_of_cmdStep`. `RunRules` is a
    `Database.sUnion` over the results and `MergeClosure` only grows `eqs`.
  * *Two states, not one.* `Database.ViewsSound` is available at the round's **pre**-state,
    which is the state the encoded rule read its rows off; the term the source's firing builds
    lands in the **post**-state. `FDatabase.SoundTerms.mono_src` does not bridge that — it
    moves a clause along `src.eqs ⊆ src'.eqs`, and `Term.app f is ∈ sd.terms` is not a clause
    at `sd` at all. `entrySound_headBuild_post` and `cong_headUnion_post` are the
    two-source forms — the reading at `sd`, the conclusion at `sd'` — and the old names are
    their `src' := src` instances.
  * *The block evaluates at all*, which is what the two domain clauses buy.
    `evalLocalActions_isSome_of_builds` is the fold: `headsDeclared` gives every applied name a
    source constructor (`Actions.Builds.of_declared`, carried on the state as
    `Database.HeadsBuild`), and `noLitUnion` gives `evalAction`'s own `union` check
    (`Actions.UnionRunnable`, whose two arms are the clause's two disjuncts). The second arm is
    the one that is not syntactic — `Spec/Scope.lean`'s `Action.Evaluable` asks a `union`
    operand to be an *application*, and a lit-free program's **variable** operand is not one —
    so it is carried as the source-run invariant `Database.NoLits`, whose data clause
    `Database.LitFree` says no term the source holds is a literal.
    `exists_step_of_mem_evalActions` is the environment part the old text called for: an action
    after a `letBind` runs at `src.env ++ τ` extended by the block's own binders, and where the
    head mentions none of them (`hlet`) the extension drops out by `Expr.eval_agreeOn`, which is
    the shape `hfired` is stated in.

  **Two conditions on the firing remain, and neither is a domain clause.** `Rule.HeadScoped` —
  every head variable is the query's, a global, or the block's own `let` — is not one because
  it costs nothing: `encodeBuild` keeps a source variable as itself and the encoded query binds
  no name the source query does not, so a head variable neither the query nor a global binds
  sticks the **encoded** head too and that firing writes on neither side; what is missing is
  the lemma that says so. `hlet` is not one either: where the block's `let`s *do* shadow the
  head, the encoded block performs the same `let`s, so `entrySound_headBuild`'s own `hval` is
  stated at the wrong environment as well, and the repair is to carry the shared prefix on both
  sides rather than to restrict the source.

  It is still the mirror of `unionsJoined_fire`, a source firing behind the target's where
  that one needs a target firing behind the source's; what it is no longer is open.

**No fixpoint is needed on the target.** `FDatabase.RoundClosed` was named as this residue's
third missing piece; it is not one. Soundness is indifferent to under-firing — `execM_contained`
says the encoded round fires a subset, and a subset of justified writes is justified — so what
this needs is the *containment*, not the fixpoint. The fixpoint is what `execM_viewLeaderRows`
and `unionsJoined_fire` want, where a firing has to be shown to have *happened*.

**The rule head is closed, and was the case worth doubting.** `encodeBuild` mints its skolem
over the arguments' *ids*, so `mem_terms_of_entrySound_skolem` makes the head's obligation
equivalent to the minted id being a source term — which, read off the key, is the fact
`encode_corresponds_invents_enode` refutes. It is not needed: the source reading the
correspondence delivers is a *choice*, and taking it to be the ids themselves is legitimate
because `Database.ViewsSound` reads a key column back as something congruent to the id and both
endpoints of a congruence are present. `Encoding/Match.lean`'s `exists_validQuerySubst_at_ids`
is that reading, `Expr.eval_transport` is why the source's head evaluation then gives the same
term rather than a congruent one, and `entrySound_headBuild` is the case — with `hfired` as its
only residue. `entrySound_headBuild_witness` is all of its hypotheses holding together at
`wProgram`, at the view entry that run really wrote.

**`addTerm` records every subterm**, so the induction also owes that no *id* and no *proof*
term is view- or `@UF`-shaped. **That obligation now collapses**, and no syntactic invariant on
ids is needed for it: `FDatabase.SoundTerms.addTerm_top` asks it only at the *written* term,
because a recorded subterm the state already holds is discharged by `FDatabase.SoundTerms`
itself (`FDatabase.subterms_of_columns`, at a subterm-closed state) and the shells a writer
mints around held terms are of neither shape (`Term.EntryShaped`, `not_entryShaped_of_ne`,
`not_entryShaped_of_length`, and `entryShaped_mem_of_transSym` for the one proof node a merge
body mints). The name separations `viewName_inj`, `viewName_ne_ufName`,
`viewName_ne_termName` and `viewName_ne_transName` are what pay for the shells, and
`Program.EncodeDomain.noAt` is still what keeps a source constructor out of the generated
namespace where a *head*'s skolem has to be told apart from an entry.

At a program with no rule the hypothesis is the source's own `evalAction`, and
`satTarget_viewsSound` is that case discharged; `ncTgt_soundTerms` is both clauses at a state
an encoded program reaches with a rule, a non-leader firing and a real `@UF` edge. -/

statement is false at `witnessProgram`, where the rebuild gives `(Add One One)` an e-class and
the source has no e-node for it (`encode_corresponds_invents_enode`). `Cong src a b` implies
both, so the forward half pays nothing for them, and `difftest correspond`'s universe is the
two term sets, so the corpus result is a measurement of exactly this restricted claim. -/

/-- **The correspondence.** `difftest correspond 64` runs exactly this claim over the 70
in-domain cases and the seventeen probes, through `sameClassF` and `closureF`, and reports
70 agreeing, 0 LOST, 0 INVENTED — and `link-diff` 0, which is what says the swept relation
is this one.

`EncodeDomain` is still needed: outside it `encode` is not defined for the program at all —
a `:merge` declaration has no table triple to emit, and a source name in the generated
namespace collides with one. `Rebuilt` is *not* a hypothesis: it is a postcondition of the
specification's rebuild command (`cmdStep_rebuilt`), and the hypothesis here names an
`execM` target, so what the two unproved halves have to lean on is the interpreter's own
`mergeSaturateF` fixpoint instead.

**Stated at the source's e-nodes**, which is where the encoding is faithful and where the
corpus sweep measures it. The two membership hypotheses cost the forward direction nothing —
`Cong src a b` implies both — and the backward direction cannot do without them:
`encode_corresponds_invents_enode` refutes the unrestricted `iff` at the witness program
`Encoding/Correspond.lean` keeps for it. -/
