# A decidable congruence closure

`Cong` is a predicate, so nothing in the semantics computes it. This computes it for a
finite, subterm-closed term set, which is what an executable interpreter needs
(`PLAN.md`, M10) and what lets a ported test case be discharged by `decide` rather than
by a hand-built derivation.

Deliberately the *obvious* algorithm rather than the efficient one: iterate a
one-step-derivable relation to a fixpoint over the finite candidate universe
`terms ×ˢ terms`. Union-find with upward merging is what egglog does and what the
proof-encoding theorems are eventually *about*; using it here would put the thing
under study inside the thing doing the studying.

Termination is by well-founded recursion on how much of the candidate universe is
still missing. Stopping only at a fixpoint is what makes `Cong.le` applicable in
`mem_closure_iff`'s completeness direction.

/-! ### Reading transitivity off the relation

`stepAdds` looks for `Cong.trans`'s middle term by scanning the candidate universe:
`∃ m ∈ terms, (p.1, m) ∈ rel ∧ (m, p.2) ∈ rel` walks all of `terms` and tests two
memberships at each, and `congStep` asks it once per pair of `terms ×ˢ terms`. A `Finset`
is a list quotient, so a membership test is a linear scan and a pass costs
`|terms|³ · |rel|` — the run's whole cost on an encoded program, where every rebuild
firing mints another proof term and `terms` grows every round while the classes stay tiny.

`rel` already holds the middle terms: the pairs `(p.1, m)` are its entries with `p.1` in
the left column, so one scan of it offers exactly the `m` worth testing, and a class is
one or two terms wide. A pass drops to `|terms|² · |rel|`, which at 127 terms is 15.4 s of
closure against 0.5 s.

`stepAddsFast` is that reading and `congStepFast` is `congStep` over it. Neither
`stepAdds` nor `congStep` moves, so every theorem in `Proofs/Closure.lean` keeps its
statement and its proof, and the `csimp` below is what points compiled code at the pair. -/
/-- Whether the entry `q` of `rel` witnesses `Cong.trans` for `p`: it starts where `p`
does, its right column is a term the closure may mention, and `rel` carries that column on
to where `p` ends.

A `Bool` rather than a conjunction of `Prop`s because `&&` short-circuits, where
`Decidable`'s `And` instance takes both decisions as arguments and so tests every column
of every entry. -/
def transWitness (terms : Finset Term) (rel : Finset (Term × Term)) (p q : Term × Term) :
    Bool :=
  (q.1 == p.1) && decide (q.2 ∈ terms) && decide ((q.2, p.2) ∈ rel)

/-- `stepAdds` with the middle term read off `rel` instead of searched for in `terms`. -/
def stepAddsFast (terms : Finset Term) (rel : Finset (Term × Term)) (p : Term × Term) :
    Bool :=
  decide (p.1 = p.2) || decide ((p.2, p.1) ∈ rel)
    || decide (∃ q ∈ rel, transWitness terms rel p q = true)
    || congrPair rel p.1 p.2

/-- **The two agree on the nose.** The middle terms `rel` offers are the middle terms
`terms` holds: an accepted `m` gives the entry `(p.1, m)`, an accepted entry the term
`q.2`. -/
